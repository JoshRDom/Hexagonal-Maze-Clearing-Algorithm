TITLE: ASSIGNMENT 2 CODE

DESCRIPTION:
Assignment 2 code is a program designed to clear a map consisting of hexagonal rooms limited
to the amount of rubbish the agent, Ronny, can hold in his bin at a time 

USAGE EXAMPLE:
To execute the program on the particular map layout outlined in the assignment, ensure that
the gui.py file and the assignment.py file are in the same folder. Then, simply open the
assignment.py file in an IDE of choice and run the .py file. The rooms explored throughout
runtime will be displayed in the console for clarification that the code is indeed running.
At the end of execution, a visual display of the solution will be open in another window
along with a summarised solution displayed in the console. Code runtime is also displayed
as a formality.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS:
To alter the maximum allowable volume of rubbish in the bin, navigate to line 263 and change
the assigned value from 5 to any desired value.

Similarly, to alter the maximum allowable weight of rubbish in the bin, navigate to line 264
and change the assigned vale from 40 to any desired value.

To change what room contains what rubbish, add, edit or remove the if and elif clauses and
their consequents between line 270 and line 289 to reflect the new rubbish characteristics
and positions.

To alter the initial volume of rubbish contained in the bin, navigate to line 296 and change
the assigned value from 0 to any desired value.

Similarly, to alter the initial weight of rubbish contained in the bin, navigate to line 297
and change the assigned value from 0 to any desired value.

To change the room that Ronny starts in, navigate to line 298 and change the assigned value
from (0,0) to any room in the map represented by the room's coordinate pair.
